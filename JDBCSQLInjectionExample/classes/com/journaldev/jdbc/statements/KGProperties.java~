/* 
 Example on reading in a properties file
 You have 2 options:
 1. Read it in using the classloader getResourceAsStream
 2. Read it in using the normal File I/O

 This example shows #2. #1 is often used for embedded property files under a
 built context as it can bundle in with the compiled code in a jarfile or be
 put in a protected place (like in servlet web dev). I don't care which you 
 use, but your choice will impact where the .properties file needs to be at
 run time for your code to find it.

 This example uses a simple Singleton pattern, so these will be lazy loaded
 on the first request to get the Properties.
